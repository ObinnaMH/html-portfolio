<h3>Vikings</h3>
<p>'I see you, Ragnar Lothbrok.' The intensity of the whole series was top notch.</p>
<h3>Jujusu Kaisen</h3>
<p>My favorite anime. It's simply art. And the Shibuya arc just started!</p>
<h3>Beyond The Light</h3>
<p>I've seen this over twenty times. I'm  not a sucker for love, but I really love this movie.</p>
